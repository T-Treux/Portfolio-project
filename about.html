              “SheCodes Plus was definitely an experience for the books... I've
              had the best and most challenging time of my life!! Through the
              challenges knowing that I created something that I could never
              have imagined creating was a huge victory in my life... SheCodes
              is a great organization, Matt & the team are beyond amazing...
              Happy to be a part of the 100,000!!!”

              “I took this workshop expecting to gain new skills to possibly
              enhance my resume. But the experience I have received was way
              beyond what I imagined, Matt and the SheCodes Team were beyond
              amazing and really helpful. I'm thankful and grateful I came
              across this workshop and I will definitely recommend anyone I know
              that wants to try coding.”
